## **How It Works**

1. **Request Loan**: A borrower sends a loan request specifying the amount, due date, and downpayment plan to a lender.
2. **Lender Response**: The lender can accept, deny, or make a counter-offer modifying the terms of the loan.
3. **Agreement**: Once an offer or counter-offer is accepted, the lender sends the agreed-upon amount via the platformâ€™s payment gateway.
4. **Repayment**: The borrower pays back the loan within the due date. If repaid on time, their reputation score increases; if late, they lose points.
5. **Accountability**: The reputation system helps maintain trust and transparency among users, ensuring responsible borrowing and lending.
